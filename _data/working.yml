  description: "I made Chaos Age, a 2D game pretty similar to Clash of Clans, using Cocos2dx js. I was responsible for core battle logic and client server synchronization. I also worked on replay feature, which allows players to watch their previous battles. I learned a lot about game development, especially in the context of a large team and a production environment. I also gained experience in working with Cocos2dx js and improving my JavaScript skills."
