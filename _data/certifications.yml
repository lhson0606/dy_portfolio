  description: "After over a year of preparation, mostly self-study, and two months of intensive preparation with a big help from one of my relatives, I took the IELTS test and got a score of 7.5, which is considered C1 level. I am very happy with the result, as it is quite a journey for me. English is just not a tool for me to land a job, communicate with people or learn new skills, but also something that I enjoy doing."
