    A music application project that I make as a final project for the course Windows Programming using WinUI3. 
    It is a simple music player that replicate the basics features of Spotify. However, it has an unique AI 
    assistant that can control the application by user's prompts, e.g "Play the next song", "Play the previous song", 
    "Play the song with the title 'Shape of You'", "Play gaming songs", "Stop/Start". The AI assistant is 
    implemented using functions calling from OpenAI API.
